# Task-01: House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

This project is part of my Machine Learning Internship with **Prodigy InfoTech**.

## 📌 Objective
To build a Linear Regression model that predicts the prices of houses based on:
- Square footage (`GrLivArea`)
- Number of bedrooms (`BedroomAbvGr`)
- Number of bathrooms (`FullBath`)

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## 📊 Results
The model was trained and tested on the Kaggle "House Prices" dataset.  
Performance was evaluated using:
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
- **R² Score**

## 📁 Dataset Source
[Kaggle - House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques)

## 📌 File
- `LinearRegression_HousePrices.ipynb` – Main notebook containing the full implementation
