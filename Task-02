# Task-02: Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

This task is part of my Machine Learning Internship at **Prodigy InfoTech**.

## 📌 Objective
To apply K-Means clustering to segment customers of a retail store based on their purchase behavior.

## 🧠 Dataset
- [Kaggle: Customer Segmentation](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python)
- File used: `Mall_Customers.csv`

## 🔍 Features Used
- Annual Income (k$)
- Spending Score (1-100)

## 📊 Techniques Used
- Data preprocessing (StandardScaler)
- K-Means clustering
- Elbow Method to choose optimal k
- Scatter plot for visualization

## 🚀 Output
The model successfully segmented customers into distinct groups based on income and spending patterns.

## 📁 File
- `CustomerSegmentation.ipynb`: Full notebook with code and results.
